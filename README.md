Oddities [![Status Zero][status-zero]][andivionian-status-classifier]
========
This repository groups several .NET libraries supporting old and obscure data formats.

Project History
---------------
This project started as part of the game reimplementation [O21][o21]. The original game is an old Windows game (from 3.1 era), and so it was necessary to implement several old Windows data formats to load the game data properly.
